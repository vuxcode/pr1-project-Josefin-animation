document.write("clicked on 3")

//to be able to give more dialgoue without changing the number of buttons i change the meaning of the variable connected to button 1, now the only problem is you cant access it as the buttons dissapear when the documentwrite arrives
var myButton1 = document.getElementById("1st")
myButton1.addEventListener("click", Choice4 )
function Choice4 () {
document.write("clicked on 4")
}


//pretty sure this isnt how to do it but trying to make a loop that keeps going as long as the response to the prompt for a name is false/aka unanswered
//everytime the loop runs it asks for a name and distplays it in the console log (theoretically)
 





//PUT EVERY BRANCH IN AN ARRAY? OPTION 1->|>2|>3 IN ONE ARRAY 






//Create asking for name loop
