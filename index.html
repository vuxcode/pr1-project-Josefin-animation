//the buttons all work now but all display after one another 



//to be able to give more dialgoue without changing the number of buttons i change the meaning of the variable connected to button 1, now the only problem is you cant access it as the buttons dissapear when the documentwrite arrives


//it will always display after clickcin option 1 button, how do i make that not happen


//pretty sure this isnt how to do it but trying to make a loop that keeps going as long as the response to the prompt for a name is false/aka unanswered
//everytime the loop runs it asks for a name and distplays it in the console log (theoretically)
 






//Create asking for name loop
