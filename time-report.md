  - *List the things you have done.*

>2025-10-23 - just made the buttons above the code, dont currently work, most likely not more than 10 mins

>2025-10-24 - gave comments and created the basic functions for the program. 10 minutes or less, yet to test if it works as intended 

works 

added prompt to ask for name 

only displays the question asked in it so not working as id like,  



>2025-10-27 work on the bare minimum to make it work

>2025-10-28 16:51 trying to make the asking for name loop work, looked at my old calculator code to remind myself how to use the prompt function properly (aprox 15 mins)


>2025-10-29 12:00 want to make the loop work and start building the "tree" so different dialogue appears when pressing the same button twice, also add the dliagoue so user knows what each button option leads to. 12:20 


>2025-10-31 my adhd has been making me avoid doing work and has been especially bad this week - _-

2025-11-04 struggling, pissin and shittin myself trying to make the damn name asking loop that wont work they way i want it to. at this point i think i should ask for help and work on the other stuff meanwhile so i can actually get stuff done.
30 mins?

>2025-11-05 GOD WHY WONT THIS STUPID LOOP WORK, ive tried both while and for but neither want to fuckin work, doesnt help that prompt() is so insistent on running no matter what so i cant tell if the loop works or if its just prompt()
aprox 20 mins

>2025-11-09 made an array, 
aprox 15 mins? end 15:19
+ approx 20 mins total 17:40


>2025-11-11 trying to figure out how to move the buttons further down the page for easier understanding for the user, though i think its a bit of a distraction, should probably make sure the buttons work for multiple clicks instead. If i cant fix that i guess i could just make a button for each color route?
ca 40 mins (ca11-12 ish)
maybe since i removed the need for a loop for the name asking maybe i can just make the program in its entirety loop so the user doesnt have to reload the page everytime
13:55 ca 9 mins

> 2025-11-14  15:00, it should be possible to change the color of the text or the boxes right? because i think that should be done then for clarity on which "route" they are on, and honestly just for my own fun. 
Trying to write out the story. should probably add more text boxes so the user can see what their choice lead to
15:34

>2025-11-17 what if the user is given the option to click the buttons but they are called "blue", "green" and "pink" and when theyve picked the buttons and name box dissapears and the dialogue appears and the user is prompted to write 1||option one||one etc to get the next step
11:41-11:56


>2025-11-18 added <h1> tags to the buttons, id also like to change the color of each button. i learned how to do that for html, pretty fun actually, so now each button has their own color.
10:02-10:17
10:22-ish - 10:37
11:00-11:17
is there a way to "reset" the buttons so they wont pop up the old options, 
12:11 - 12:26 

16:40-16:55
total 1h & 15mins


>2025-11-19 tried to make the name accessible outside of its function but i have yet to make that happen, fixed the option1 buttons problem but back at square 1 on how to make the button reusable to the next options without it displaying all of them at once or none of them
10:15 -11:22 - aprox 1h


>2025-11-20 worst case scenario if i cant make the buttons work ill just keep the one for the name input and just let the rest be if and if else confirm boxes i guess

>2025-11-21 got advice on how to fix my button problem yesterday so i will try to put it into practice today.
11:50-12:35 or aprox 30 mins

6.2 hours total atm
need to to 1h and 13 mins -ish every day

>2025-11-24 
started at aroun 10:00 work to understnad the array inside array situation. Aaaaa nothing works now.
Made the "intro" pop up after the user inputs their name. Dont think i quite understand how the "route=0" variable interacts with the arrays
12:35, aprox 1h and 20 mins
+ aprox 1 h  (13:00 at school)


>2025-11-26 want to finish writing the story so it can be over and done with so i can focus on putting the correct responses in the arrays.
12:00    (30mins)
23:30 (15 mins)

>2025-11-27 figure out wtf is wrong with <!--else if (username==null) {alert("Please input a name") console.log("or at else if")-->'
11:25 (15mins)

>2025-11-28 struggling how to picture it in my mind in how i should format the if statements for the dialogue arrays.
