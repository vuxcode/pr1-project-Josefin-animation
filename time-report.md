>2025-10-23 - just made the buttons above the code, dont currently work, most likely not more than 10 mins

>2025-10-24 - gave comments and created the basic functions for the program. 10 minutes or less, yet to test if it works as intended 

works 

added prompt to ask for name 

only displays the question asked in it so not working as id like,  



>2025-10-27 work on the bare minimum to make it work

>2025-10-28 16:51 trying to make the asking for name loop work, looked at my old calculator code to remind myself how to use the prompt function properly (aprox 15 mins)


>2025-10-29 12:00 want to make the loop work and start building the "tree" so different dialogue appears when pressing the same button twice, also add the dliagoue so user knows what each button option leads to. 12:20 


>2025-10-31 my adhd has been making me avoid doing work and has been especially bad this week - _-

2025-11-04 struggling, pissin and shittin myself trying to make the damn name asking loop that wont work they way i want it to. at this point i think i should ask for help and work on the other stuff meanwhile so i can actually get stuff done.
30 mins?

>2025-11-05 GOD WHY WONT THIS STUPID LOOP WORK, ive tried both while and for but neither want to fuckin work, doesnt help that prompt() is so insistent on running no matter what so i cant tell if the loop works or if its just prompt()
aprox 20 mins

>2025-11-09 made an array, 
aprox 15 mins? end 15:19
+ approx 20 mins total 17:40


>2025-11-11 trying to figure out how to move the buttons further down the page for easier understanding for the user, though i think its a bit of a distraction, should probably make sure the buttons work for multiple clicks instead. If i cant fix that i guess i could just make a button for each color route?
ca 40 mins (ca11-12 ish)
maybe since i removed the need for a loop for the name asking maybe i can just make the program in its entirety loop so the user doesnt have to reload the page everytime
13:55 ca 9 mins
