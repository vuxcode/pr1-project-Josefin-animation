# Bug List

> Make a list of the things that don't work as expected. Keep a list of things that you have fixed and try to document how you solved them.

1. Problem: the prompt for a name displays the question in the console log and not the name input
2. the loop doesnt work and the console log inside does nothing
3. Less of a problem n more of a pet peeve, id like to move the buttons so they are centered underneath the dialogue

4. i want the user to be able to use the buttons over and over again but if i use document.write for the functions they dissapear, and if i use confirm() then the output for the intendedn second click of the 1st button appears anyway.

5. when the user presses optin 1 button, the dialogue for option 4 comes too since the condition has been met, have to come up with a way to make it not appear until the button is clicked again.


1. Fixed: when pressin the buttons, no mattter which one it says the one belonging to the first. have no idea how it fixed itself.
